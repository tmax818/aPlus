## 5.1 Given a scenario, use the best practice methodology to resolve problems.
Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before implementing changes
1. Identify the problem
- Question the user and identify user changes to computer and perform backups before making changes
- Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes
- Review system and application logs
2. Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)
- If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms
3. Test the theory to determine cause
- Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve problem
- If theory is not confirmed re-establish new theory or escalate
4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
